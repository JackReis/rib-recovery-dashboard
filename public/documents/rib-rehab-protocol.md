# Rib Rehabilitation Protocol - Hansen Procedure Recovery

*Generated from Gemini 3 research - December 2025*

---

## 📋 Medical Context

### Patient Profile
- **Procedure:** Hansen technique (bilateral costal margin repair)
- **Date:** October 2024
- **Current Status:** 14-15 months post-op (50% through 2-year healing window)
- **Technique:** Ribs 8-10 sutured to rib 7, reconstructing costal margin
- **Hardware Status:** Bioabsorbable plates degrading via hydrolysis ("gravel-like" debris)
- **Primary Issue:** "Instability Gap" - hardware failed but biological fusion incomplete

### Related Conditions
- Right 5th metatarsal Jones fracture (fixed with screw)
- Left 10th rib fracture (non-displaced)
- Kinetic chain disruption affecting Spiral Line fascia

## 🔄 Biomechanical Adaptations Post-Hansen

### 1. Altered Rib Mechanics

#### Bucket-Handle Restriction
- **Normal Function:** Lower ribs (7-10) elevate laterally during inspiration (~30% thoracic expansion)
- **Post-Surgery:** Motion restricted by 10-20% to promote stability
- **Compensation:** Increased reliance on pump-handle (upper rib) mechanics
- **Risk:** Accessory muscle overuse (scalenes, upper trapezius), cervical stress

#### Stress Redistribution
- **New Keystone:** Rib 7 acts as anchor point
- **Increased Load:** 10-20% more compression at T6-T7 costovertebral joints
- **Long-term Risk:** 5-10% develop compensatory thoracic rotation within 1-2 years
- **Prognosis:** 80-90% pain relief at 2 years with proper rehabilitation

### 2. Kinetic Chain Integration

#### Spiral Line Pathway
1. **Right Foot:** Peroneus longus/brevis → lateral arch stability
2. **Ascending:** Right biceps femoris → sacrotuberous ligament
3. **Crossing:** Pelvis → left internal/external obliques
4. **Termination:** Left intercostals and serratus anterior (ribs 7-10)

#### Jones Fracture Impact
- Reduced right foot eversion → "kink" in Spiral Line
- Asymmetric pull on left obliques/ribs
- Exacerbates post-Hansen tethering
- Risk of left thoracic compression during gait

#### 4. Wall Angel Progression
**Position:** Back against wall
**Technique:**
- Arms at 90° (goal position)
- Slide up/down maintaining contact
- Stop before compensation
- 8-10 reps x 2 sets
**Modification:** Start with arms lower if restricted

#### 5. Standing Wood Chops (Light Band)
**Setup:** 3-5 lb resistance band at waist height
**Technique:**
- Feet wide, right foot forward
- Chop high-right to low-left
- Limit rotation to 45°
- Add right heel lift on initiation
- 10 reps each direction x 2 sets
**Purpose:** Controlled Spiral Line integration

## 📚 Scientific Rationale

### Collagen Synthesis
- Vitamin C is rate-limiting cofactor
- Morning dosing optimizes synthesis
- Hydrolyzed form improves absorption
- 12-week minimum for tissue changes

### Biomechanical Adaptation
- Wolff's Law: bone responds to stress
- Davis's Law: soft tissue remodels per demands
- Progressive loading prevents adhesions
- Movement variability prevents compensation

### Pain Science
- Central sensitization after 3 months
- Movement builds confidence
- Graded exposure reduces fear
- Success breeds success
