# Shoulder Instability & Hand Therapy Protocols

*Integrated Upper Extremity Rehabilitation for Hansen Recovery*

---

## 🦴 Part 1: Shoulder Instability Management

### Clinical Context
- **Primary Issue:** SICK Scapula secondary to rib instability
- **Mechanism:** Loss of stable rib platform affects scapular positioning
- **Pattern:** Forward tilt (Pec Minor dominance), winging, dyskinesis
- **Principle:** "Treat the ribs to fix the shoulder"

---

### Shoulder Assessment Protocol

#### Visual Assessment
**Standing Posture Analysis:**
1. **Front View:**
   - Shoulder height symmetry
   - Clavicle angle
   - AC joint prominence

2. **Side View:**
   - Forward head position
   - Rounded shoulders
   - Scapular tilt

3. **Back View:**
   - Scapular winging
   - Medial border prominence
   - Inferior angle position

#### Movement Testing
**Test 1: Wall Angel**
- Back against wall
- Arms in "goal post" position
- Slide up and down
- Note: Can't keep contact? Restriction location?

**Test 2: Scapular Wall Test**
- Stand arm's length from wall
- Push-up position against wall
- Note: Winging? Asymmetry?

**Test 3: Empty Can Test**
- Arms at 30° forward
- Thumbs down
- Lift against resistance
- Note: Weakness? Pain?
