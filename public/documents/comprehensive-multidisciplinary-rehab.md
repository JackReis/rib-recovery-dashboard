# Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation Protocol

*Bilateral Hansen Procedure with Kinetic Chain Integration*

---

## 🎯 Protocol Overview

### Integrated Approach
This protocol addresses your complex presentation:
- **Primary:** Bilateral Hansen procedure recovery (ribs 8-10 to 7)
- **Secondary:** Right foot Jones fracture kinetic chain effects
- **Tertiary:** Compensatory patterns throughout body
- **Holistic:** Mental health and lifestyle integration

### Key Principles
1. **Bilateral symmetry** is now impossible - work with new reality
2. **Spiral Line integration** from foot to ribs is critical
3. **Small, distributed motion** beats large, focused motion
4. **Breathing drives everything** - it's both assessment and intervention

---

## 📊 Assessment Framework

### Daily Self-Assessment Protocol

#### Morning Check (Before Rising)
**Position:** Supine in bed
**Process:**
1. **Breathing Pattern:**
   - Hand on chest, hand on belly
   - 5 natural breaths
   - Note: Chest dominant? Belly dominant? Balanced?

2. **Rib Mobility:**
   - Hands on lower ribs
   - Deep breath in
   - Feel for: Equal expansion? Left restricted? Right restricted?

3. **Pain Mapping:**
   - Mental scan from head to toe
   - Rate each area 0-10
   - Note: Sharp? Dull? Burning? Aching?

4. **Stiffness Assessment:**
   - Gentle limb movements
   - Note areas of resistance
   - Compare to yesterday

#### Movement Screen (After Rising)
**Perform gently, stop if pain >4/10**

1. **Standing Posture Check:**
   - Back against wall
   - Note gaps: Low back? Mid back? Neck?
   - Shoulder blade position

2. **Rotation Test:**
   - Arms crossed on chest
   - Turn left, turn right
   - Measure: Nose alignment with shoulder

3. **Side Bend Test:**
   - Hand slides down leg
   - Compare left vs right distance
   - Note: Pull or pinch sensation?

4. **Single Leg Stand:**
   - 30 seconds each leg
   - Note: Which is easier? Wobble pattern?

#### Evening Review
**Document in journal:**
- Best part of day physically
- Worst part of day physically
- Instability events count
- Activities that helped
- Activities that hurt

- Distance: 100 yards focused walking

#### Week 5-8: Integration

## 🧘 Mind-Body Integration

### Pain Neuroscience Education

#### Understanding Your Pain
1. **Pain ≠ Damage** after 3 months
2. **Sensitization** means nervous system overprotective
3. **Movement is medicine** when dosed correctly
4. **Fear increases pain** through muscle tension

### Stress Management Techniques

#### Quick Calm (2 minutes)
1. **4-7-8 Breathing:**
   - Inhale 4 counts
   - Hold 7 counts
   - Exhale 8 counts
   - Repeat 4 cycles

#### Body Scan (10 minutes)
1. Start at toes, notice sensation
2. Move up slowly through each body part
3. Don't judge, just notice
4. End at crown of head
5. Three deep breaths to finish

#### Progressive Relaxation (15 minutes)
1. Tense muscle group 5 seconds
2. Release suddenly
3. Notice the contrast
4. Move through whole body
5. End with whole-body tension/release

### Sleep Optimization

#### Pre-Sleep Routine
**9:00 PM:** Screens off, dim lights
**9:15 PM:** Magnesium supplement
**9:30 PM:** Gentle stretching
**9:45 PM:** Breathing practice in bed
**10:00 PM:** Sleep position setup

#### Positioning for Ribs
**Best:** Right side-lying (unaffected)
- Pillow between knees
- Pillow supporting left arm
- Small towel roll at waist

**Acceptable:** Supine
- Knees elevated on pillows
- Arms supported
- Head slightly elevated

**Avoid:** Left side-lying initially
- Increases pressure on surgical site
- May cause instability sensation
