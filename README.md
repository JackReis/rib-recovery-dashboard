# Rib Recovery Dashboard

An interactive recovery dashboard for tracking and managing rehabilitation from Hansen procedure (bilateral rib reconstruction). Currently 16 months post-op (February 2026), in "The Instability Gap" phase with extended 24+ month recovery timeline.

## 🎯 Purpose

This dashboard was created to:
- Track daily symptoms and progress
- Follow structured morning protocols
- Monitor rehabilitation exercises
- Document pain levels and instability events
- Provide quick access to emergency protocols
- Maintain adherence to recovery guidelines

## 🏥 Medical Context

- **Procedure:** Hansen technique (bilateral 9th/10th costal margin reconstruction)
- **Date:** October 11, 2024
- **Current Status:** "The Instability Gap" - Hansen plates failing (creating "gravel-like debris") but biological fusion incomplete
- **Dr. Hansen's 2025 CT Review:** "Repair sites look good" - surgical sites healing well
- **Timeline:** 16 months into extended 24+ month recovery window (potentially longer)
- **Current Focus:** Shaping costal margin muscle tone and aligning ribs/musculature before scar tissue 'sets'
- **Key Recovery Metric:** Pectoral muscle engagement ability - extreme difficulty indicates overall dysfunction
- **Complications:**
  - Chest/shoulder tightness from compensatory guarding for rib instability
  - Right foot Jones fracture affects kinetic chain to left ribs

- Mobile phones

## 🔑 Key Protocols

### Daily Hydration
- Minimum 80oz water
- 1000mg Vitamin C (500mg morning, 500mg evening)
- 15g collagen morning (optional 10g evening)
- 400mg magnesium before bed

### Emergency Decompression Reset
For rib slips - DO NOT push the rib back:
1. Lie on right side
2. Reach left arm overhead
3. Deep breath into left flank
4. Let gravity + breath reset position

### Baby Lifting Strategy
- Use step stool by crib
- Step up before lifting
- Engage lats first
- Never twist while holding

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Lucide React** - Icons
- **Local Storage** - Data persistence (future enhancement)

## 📊 Data Tracking

Currently tracks:
- Pain levels (0-10 scale)
- Instability events (slips/clicks)
- **Pectoral engagement ability (0-10 scale) - KEY RECOVERY METRIC**
  - 0 = Cannot engage at all
  - 5 = Some engagement with compensation
  - 10 = Normal engagement without guarding
- Chest/shoulder tightness levels
- Morning protocol adherence
- Exercise completion
- Daily progress history
