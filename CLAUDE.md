# Rib Recovery Dashboard

- Interactive recovery dashboard for tracking rehabilitation from Hansen procedure (bilateral rib reconstruction)
- Primary remote + CI/CD is GitHub: `git@github.com:JackReis/rib-recovery-dashboard.git`
- Deploy target is GitHub Pages (not GitLab Pages)
- Legacy GitLab remote is archival/fallback only: `git@gitlab.com:jackrei/rib-recovery-dashboard.git`
- Wellness API serves JSON endpoints at `/api/`

## Operational Rules (Important)

- Treat `origin` (GitHub) as the only default push/pull target.
- Do **not** push to `gitlab` unless explicitly asked by the user.
- If pipeline/deploy issues appear, inspect GitHub Actions first.
